Twitter’s REST API: 
Allows you to search terms or get tweets based on specific parameters. This doesn’t give you live data. More useful if you want to do some analytics on historical data.

Twitter’s Streaming API: 
Gives you live tweets data as per your request and keeps sending it until you ask it to stop. This is ideally useful when you are doing analytics over live campaigns on twitter, etc.

------
Do I want live tweets from people around the world on a specific term?
or 
Do I want historical tweets from people around the world on a specific term?

First one is Streaming API and second is Search API.

----
 Live is basically real time tweets that are being tweeted for your search times right now. For historical data you can use Rest APIs.
